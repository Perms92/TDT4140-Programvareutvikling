If you are just starting out with open source one of the most important things to include,
is good documentation. This starts with a solid README file. At its core a README should include:

# RooME

## Project information:
//What does your project do? Share the vision of the need that your project is trying to meet.

The project RooME is a school project at NTNU Gl√∏shaugen, Norway, in the subject TDT4140 Programvareutvikling.
What we are trying to produce is a software system that gathers information from different people, 
and produces a timetable based on criteria from these. 

The goal is to automate the process of planning a semesterplan for every student and lecturer, 
reducing both time and cost of the process.

   
## Setup:
//How is it set up? 
//If someone were to pick up your codebase today how would they get everything running in their local environment.

To have the program running as intended, 
you will first have to be connected to a NTNU-VPN so you can connect to our database.

Step 1: Connect to NTNU VPN.
Step 2: Run the RooME.jar file in terminal/cmd. Eventually import project into IDE of choice and run there.
Step 3: ?
Step 4: ?
Step 5: ?


## Usage:
How is it used? Once it's up and running provide some very descriptive examples of usage.

When you run the program you will see the start page with 
certain buttons telling you which functions you can choose between.

The first button would provide the ability to search for an book a room within the database we have provided.
The second button is where to click if you want to fill in and save your criteria for lectures in a coming semester,
this is also the main functionality of our program.
The third button is planned to be used for changing a previous added criteria, while there is no functionality for this yet.
The fourth button will turn into a help/information page about the program.

## Project shape:
Is it in good shape? Do you have code climate, codeship,
 or other tools running to indicate the health of the project? Include information on dependencies as well.

As the three of us implementing the system are considered beginners in software engineering with ongoing studies, 
the project is self reflects this. Meaning both code climate, codeship and others aspects of our code should be considered
primitive and eventually full of errors or other faults.

## How to help
How can others help? Collaboration yields amazing software. 
Make it easy for others to get involved by letting them know how to submit new features, 
report issues, or offer other assistance.

People outside our project group should not participate in the project until our deadline 27th of April 2017.
After this date those who want can either fork the repo making their version, or ask to join our repo.

## Licenes Information
License information Don't forget to let others know what license your project is released under. 
Not sure? Oreilly has an open book on understanding licensing.

We have to come back to licensing the project.
