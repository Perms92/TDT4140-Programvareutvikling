Here is some information about the different classes
and how they work in the program

This class is, as it's name indicates, the main class.
It is the class the program will run through when we don't
have a user interface to go through.

it up to a test room.

It takes a series of variables that makes the person
The variables are: name, proffesion (student/lecturer), person ID.

RoomCriteria.java
This class takes in the criterias a lecturer have for a room.
It takes in if the lecturer needs projector, white- and blackboard,
experiment table, and how many students he expects.
